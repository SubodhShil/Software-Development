> # **`C#`**

### Best practices

1. 1 file per class.

## Steps to run your first C# program

1. Create new project: `dotnet new`
2. Run file: `dotnet run`

-   Methods in C# can only be called or invoked from another method such as the 'Main' method.
-   'var' is a variable declaration keyword that can automatically determine values without any explicit value type. Variables declared with 'var' keyword can only be defined within a block scope.

### `TryParse`

`TryParse()` is supposed to be used on a string input to check if it can be converted to an integer. This method converts the string representation of a number.
