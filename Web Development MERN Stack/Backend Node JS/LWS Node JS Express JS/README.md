## `app.all()`

The app.all() method in Express.js is used to define a route handler that will handle all HTTP methods for a particular route. This means it can respond to GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and any other HTTP request method.

### To enable case sensitive routing URL: `app.enable('case sensitive routing');`
