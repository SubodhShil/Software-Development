> # **```Backend development```**

Backend development comprises **database** and **server**.

- Node.js is single threaded but non-blocking.

Modules in Node.js: Modules are functions and there are three types of modules available in node js,

1. Built in modules
2. Third party modules (install via NPM js)
3. File based modules

> # ```Working with Express.js```

Express.js is a framework for Node.js that is used to create backend servers with ease.

## <p align="center"><b>Create Express.js Project</b></p>

To create an Express.js project, follow these steps:

1. Run the command to initialize the Node Package Manager(NPM):  
            ```npm init -y```  
    **(1.1)** This command creats an package.json file into the directory you've initialized the project.

2. Install express js package and nodemon package together by running this command:  
    ```npm install express nodemon```  
    An alternative command is:  
    ```npm i express nodemon```  
    **(2.1)** instead of 'install' keyword we can use 'i'  
    **(2.2)** nodemon is a package that let us track change and show new changes realtime without restarting the server again and again  
    **(2.3)** to install multiple package you have to write the package name after 'npm install' or 'npm i' that you want to install.

3. **Use .gitignore to exclude node_modules.**  
     Node modules are libraries that are hefty size. So, it is not a good idea to add those node modules to your github repository. To not include node_modules into your github repo,  
    **(3.1)** <ins>first of all create a file with name ```.gitignore```</ins>  
    **(3.2)** In the .gitignore file write the directory you want to exclude, in the case we have to exclude node_modules folder. So, we will write ```node_modules/```  
4. The basic command to run an express project using nodemon package is: ```nodemon index.js```  
But, you can change the long command by do the following:  
    **(4.1)** Go to package.json file  
    **(4.2)** You'll see this object:  

    ```
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    }
    ```

    **(4.3)** Replace above code with this:

    ```
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "start": "nodemon index.js"
    },
    ```

    The line "start": "nodemon index.js" will let you replace long command **nodemon index.js** with  
    ```npm start```

## **ü§î What is Port?**

üëâ Port is is endpoint (URL of a server) or more specificly a number where your express application should run or listen to. **The default port of epxress is ***port 3000***.** You access the server at <http://localhost:3000> in your web browser.

We can change our port as our preference by specifying the port number as an argument to the listen() method.

``` jsx
/// import express module to utilize 
import express from "express";
const app = express();
const CORS = require("cors");
/// Your application will serve at http://localhost:PORT
/// process.env.PORT is a variable where port value is declared in .env file, it is a good practice to store credentials like port in .evn file
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5500;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.use(CORS());

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at port ${PORT}`);
});
```

To execute the aforementioned application, carry out step 4 of **Create Express.js Project**.

## **```Error```**

<ins>Error message:</ins> **..\nodemon.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.**  

Operating system: Windows 11

**Fix: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63423584/how-to-fix-error-nodemon-ps1-cannot-be-loaded-because-running-scripts-is-disabl>**

Other Notes:

1. How to update a package: ```npm update <your_package_name>```
2. The **index.js** file should be simple and clean, it should mainly contain server listen methods.

## **```POST Request```**
POST request ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶π‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ‡ßá client ‡¶•‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßá server ‡¶è ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶® data ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶†‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßã, ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶Æ‡¶® ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶® form submit ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶≤‡ßá user ‡¶è‡¶∞ submitted data server ‡¶è ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡ßü ‡•§ 

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>

1. By default or implicitly every request sent as 'GET' request in node js.  
2. Use fetch with method POST.  
3. Add  headers to the fetch. "content-type": "application/json"
4. Add body to the fetch to send data and make sure to use JSON.stringify to send data.
5. Make sure adding this line: app.use(express.json())
</details>

## **```Modules```**

Modules are simply functions.

### **Import and export module by 'import' and 'export' keyword**

Add ```"type": "module",``` in your package.json file object.

- to export multiple modules export them as an object.

```javascript
const moduleA = "moduleA";
const moduleB = "moduleB";
const moduleC = "moduleC";

export {moduleA,moduleB,moduleC};
```

## **```When to use NoSQL```**
- Suitable for data heavy application and scalability (popular for horizontal it's scalability model).
- NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured data.
- User for encouraging application paradigm like microservices and real-time streaming.
- If the service requires a scale-out architecture.
- Optimized for specific data types, often offering faster read/write speeds for certain queries.
- Has rich features like: indexing, aggregation, file store, etc.

## **```CRUD Operations```**
1. C = Create
2. R = Read
3. U = Update
4. D = Delete
