> **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory of a specific created in the runtime or execution time.

-   In Java, Array objects may not be continuously allocated.
-   The `new` keyword is used to create an object of a class.
-   By default, a non-initialized integer array would automatically be allocated with value of 0.
-   Objects are stored in the heap memory.
-   Java is always call by value. 
-   <ins>**Java ArrayList**</ins> is the substitution for Vector in C++.

### Literals

Literals are the strict values assigned to a variable. 

- There can only one public class in a java program file. 


### Java doesn't have the support for multiple inheritance. The solution is to use Interfaces.

### In Java, any class that extends an abstract class must implement all its abstract methods, or it must itself be declared abstract.


1. Class -> Bleurprint for objects   
2. Interface -> Blueprint for classes 

### All interfaces are abstract, means every declared method is an abstract method.
