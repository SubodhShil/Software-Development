1. Git is a tool that lets you edit and modify files at the same time tracking the history of each modification. 
2. Modifications are stored as history and it is possible to travel to a particular history, retrive and do more task utilizing git.

So, on the basis of abovementioned traits git is said to be a **'Version Control System (VCS)'**. 

> Now, Git is by default works in a local machine, but in todays robust software development it is crucial to have all our source code saved safe in the web. So, different other services come up with the idea of merging git version controling to the web. Most popular among them are: GitHub, BitBucket.

### ðŸš€ What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 
ðŸ‘‰ Git is an open-source and independent version controling system can track version and modification of files or source codes. Whereas, GitHub is a cloud-based solution for hosting git repositories. So, we can say GitHub build on top of Git. 

### Why do you need VCS? 
Software developer continously test, change in it's source code. Any change that breaks the software isn't good and not applicable for a customer-facing production grade solution. So, if in case the test or change have made but due to some requirements or fault been made due to the change, it has to reverted. Git is the solution that can help acheive previous code.
